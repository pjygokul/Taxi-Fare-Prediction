To describe the requirements for running your taxi fare prediction project on GitHub, you should include information about the necessary applications, libraries, frameworks, APIs, and environment configurations. Hereâ€™s an example breakdown that you can use to describe it in your GitHub repository:

---

### Taxi Fare Prediction System - Requirements

#### 1. **Applications and Environments**

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have Python installed for running the backend scripts.
  - Download from [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Flask Framework**: For creating the web application (backend).
  - Install using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Used for the front end of the web application to build user interfaces.

#### 2. **Libraries and Dependencies**

Make sure to install the following Python libraries:

- **Flask**: Web framework to run the backend.
  ```bash
  pip install Flask
  ```

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library.
  ```bash
  pip install pandas
  ```

- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.
  ```bash
  pip install scikit-learn
  ```

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: To fetch weather data for predictions. You need an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
  - Install `requests` for API interaction:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

- **OpenCage API**: Used for geocoding pickup and dropoff locations using latitude and longitude. Obtain an API key from [OpenCage Data](https://opencagedata.com/).
  - Use `requests` to call this API.

- **TomTom Traffic API**: To fetch real-time traffic data.
  - You will need an API key from [TomTom Developer](https://developer.tomtom.com/).
  - Install `requests`:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

- **NumPy**: For handling numerical data.
  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  ```

- **XGBoost**: For the Gradient Boosting models.
  ```bash
  pip install xgboost
  ```

#### 3. **APIs**

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Used for fetching weather data based on the pickup location.
- **OpenCage Geocoding API**: For converting locations (addresses) to latitude and longitude and vice versa.
- **TomTom Traffic API**: To fetch real-time traffic predictions.
  
Make sure you add your API keys directly in the code.

#### 4. **Modeling Tools**

- **Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost**: Implemented for fare prediction based on historical data.
  
#### 5. **Data Sources**

- Historical taxi trip data, including the following features:
  - `pickup_latitude`
  - `dropoff_latitude`
  - `pickup_longitude`
  - `dropoff_longitude`
  - `trip_distance`
  - `passenger_count`
  - `fare_amount`
  
This data can be stored as CSV files or in a database.

#### 6. **Running the Application**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your API keys**:
   - OpenWeatherMap API Key
   - OpenCage API Key
   - TomTom Traffic API Key
   
   Add these keys in the code wherever API calls are made.

5. **Run the Flask web application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the web application**:
   Open a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
