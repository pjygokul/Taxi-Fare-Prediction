To describe the requirements for running your taxi fare prediction project on GitHub, you should include information about the necessary applications, libraries, frameworks, APIs, and environment configurations. Here’s an example breakdown that you can use to describe it in your GitHub repository:

---

### Taxi Fare Prediction System - Requirements

#### 1. **Applications and Environments**

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have Python installed for running the backend scripts.
  - Download from [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Flask Framework**: For creating the web application (backend).
  - Install using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Used for the front end of the web application to build user interfaces.

#### 2. **Libraries and Dependencies**

Make sure to install the following Python libraries:

- **Flask**: Web framework to run the backend.
  ```bash
  pip install Flask
  ```

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library.
  ```bash
  pip install pandas
  ```

- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.
  ```bash
  pip install scikit-learn
  ```

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: To fetch weather data for predictions. You need an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
  - Install `requests` for API interaction:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

- **OpenCage API**: Used for geocoding pickup and dropoff locations using latitude and longitude. Obtain an API key from [OpenCage Data](https://opencagedata.com/).
  - Use `requests` to call this API.

- **TomTom Traffic API**: To fetch real-time traffic data.
  - You will need an API key from [TomTom Developer](https://developer.tomtom.com/).
  - Install `requests`:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

- **NumPy**: For handling numerical data.
  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  ```

- **XGBoost**: For the Gradient Boosting models.
  ```bash
  pip install xgboost
  ```

#### 3. **APIs**

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Used for fetching weather data based on the pickup location.
- **OpenCage Geocoding API**: For converting locations (addresses) to latitude and longitude and vice versa.
- **TomTom Traffic API**: To fetch real-time traffic predictions.
  
Make sure you add your API keys directly in the code.

#### 4. **Modeling Tools**

- **Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost**: Implemented for fare prediction based on historical data.
  
#### 5. **Data Sources**

- Historical taxi trip data, including the following features:
  - `pickup_latitude`
  - `dropoff_latitude`
  - `pickup_longitude`
  - `dropoff_longitude`
  - `trip_distance`
  - `passenger_count`
  - `fare_amount`
  
This data can be stored as CSV files or in a database.

#### 6. **Running the Application**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your API keys**:
   - OpenWeatherMap API Key
   - OpenCage API Key
   - TomTom Traffic API Key
   
   Add these keys in the code wherever API calls are made.

5. **Run the Flask web application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the web application**:
   Open a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
